# Context of files in this directory/folder

In this folder lives the .db files that store the data of Nahuatl files from the
data that was given to us rather than scraped. It's been pre-processed in accordance
of validating it against what was scraped. It has also been annotated to better present
the data for lexicon use. [nahuatl_local.db](nahuatl_local.db) is the one in use (which has been cleaned up because after a semester's worth of work, has been bloated with temporary stages of the data). [nahuatl_local - Copy.db](nahuatl_local%20-%20Copy.db) is the file that has all of these temporary stages of the data.
