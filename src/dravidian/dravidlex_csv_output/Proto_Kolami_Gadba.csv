More often than not, the semantics of the stem is closely linked to the idea of old age or being elder (cf. 'old woman'; 'grandmother'; 'matron'; 'elder brother's wife'). The relations of this root with PDR*átaiare also unclear. I would venture to guess that the original differentiation is seen in Kolami-Gadba, where*átai= 'father's sister', whereas*ávai= 'father's mother', but this is very flimsy evidence. // Present in 4/6 branches.",,,,,,,7,8,
