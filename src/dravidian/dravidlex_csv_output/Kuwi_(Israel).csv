However, in modern dialects they have been  often contaminated,     as in Kui. Moreover, some Kuwi dialects have inherited PDR possessive forms, or,  rather, the     tendency of their ""possessivisation"": the formmāiyagoes back to*mā-yaya'us +  mother',      while  Kuwi_Fmāyaand Kuwi_Smīyago back to*mī-yaya'you +  mother'.  The initial*y-in the form for 'mother' has to be postulated principally because of different vocalism   in     these    two  forms (cf. PK*yamb-> Kuwi_Famb-, Kuwi_Simb-). In Kuwi_F*yaya>*īya(and not*āya, which would have been regular) because of the influence of  the following-y-(like*yambi>imbibecause of the following-i-). In   Kui  the   variants-i-and-j-seem to be free; the variant-j-should be the regular one,  but  we  may  suggest that the variant with-i-has been preserved for expressive reasons. As  for other Kui  dialects, it is hard to say whether some of them have lost one of the two forms  (*ayaand*yaya), having generalized the other one for both meanings, or whether they have  merged  phonetically,  since  reflexes  of  PK*ya-are unknown. Thus,  Kuwi_Isrāyamay   reflectaya, having lost the form*yaya, or may represent both of them, if we suggest a  development*ya->ā-(indeed, the second explanation is preferable, since otherwise it is  impossible to  explain the vowel length).",,,364,,2,,,,https://starlingdb.org/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&basename=%2fdata%2fdrav%2fkuiet&text_number=35&root=config
