Two forms that continuously crop up all over SDR are the bisyllabic stem*aṇai-, with a simple retroflex nasal, and the monosyllabic stem*anḍ-with a retroflex cluster. Most of the other stems (aṇi-,aṇa-,aṇ-) are only found in the Tamil area and may reflect dialectalisms or latter day contaminations. As to whether*aṇai-and*anḍ-go back to the same source, this is somewhat questionable. They are certainly two different entities on the PSDR level, albeit with similar meanings; on that level, there was no productive model according to which*aṇai-could become*anḍ-or vice versa.",,,0120,,1,,,,https://starlingdb.org/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&basename=%2fdata%2fdrav%2fsdret&text_number=106&root=config
