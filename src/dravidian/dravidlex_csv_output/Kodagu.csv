"ala- (alap-, aland-)",to suffer,"alambalɨhurry; ?alas-(alasi-) (curry, rice) becomes spoiled",Dravidian etymology,,,,,,,,,"In Tamil there exists evidence for at least three bisyllabic stems with similar semantics:ala-,alu-,alai-. The variant with-u-is the least well represented of the three and may be secondary (e. g., a back-formation fromaluppu, which itself would be a reduced dialectal variant of*alappu). The other two, however, both find parallels outside of the Tamil-Malayalam area (cf. the Kan. oppositionala-ale), and the question is whether they go back to the same root or not. According to the general policy of DEDR, we would have to judge in favour of the former; in this particular case, however, even Burrow & Emeneau note that ""these etyma and those s. v. Ta.alaŋkuseem to have started from two roots with different basic meanings: suffer and move, shake"". It seems, therefore, reasonable to trace*ala-back to a stem with the basic meaning 'suffer', and*alai-back to 'move, shake, dangle', with a whole bunch of derived forms (see*ala-ŋ-,*ala-ṭ-, etc.).

In order to trace them back to the same source we would have to suppose that both go back to an early, and presumably, verbal root like*aṇ-, and even then the two lines of derivation would be rather vague. I would deem it more reasonable to reconstruct a PSDR nominal stem*aṇai""embankment"". Tamil and Malayalamaṇṭa(i), with an obviously narrower meaning ('field bund', but not 'dam' in general) are a different, more local, formation, maybe contaminated with*anḍ-' to approach, join' (?). As for Kodaguaṇḍa, in this case the retroflex cluster may actually go back to a simple retroflex nasal, i. e. reflect the earlier*aṇai; cf. a similar case in PSDR*pUṇai'bamboo'.

Two forms that continuously crop up all over SDR are the bisyllabic stem*aṇai-, with a simple retroflex nasal, and the monosyllabic stem*anḍ-with a retroflex cluster. Most of the other stems (aṇi-,aṇa-,aṇ-) are only found in the Tamil area and may reflect dialectalisms or latter day contaminations. As to whether*aṇai-and*anḍ-go back to the same source, this is somewhat questionable. They are certainly two different entities on the PSDR level, albeit with similar meanings; on that level, there was no productive model according to which*aṇai-could become*anḍ-or vice versa.",,,0120,,1,,,,https://starlingdb.org/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&basename=%2fdata%2fdrav%2fsdret&text_number=106&root=config
