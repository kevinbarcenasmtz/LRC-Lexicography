*ac-,mould (n.),,,,,,,,,,,"Burrow & Emeneau tentatively suggest an IA origin for the root (Old Indiansañcaka-, Panj.sañcā, saccā""mould""). This is highly unlikely, because inlaut-c-suggests a recent borrowing from one of IA dialects where*-ñc->*-cc-; on the other hand, the ubiquitous dropping of the initial sibilant suggests a very old borrowing. Proto-Dravidian origin (with an old meaning like ""mould"" - not necessarily for casting iron) is thus more probable at the moment. // Present in 2/6 branches.",,,,,,,1,1,

*aḍái,to hide; to press down,,,,,,,,,,,"The original form of this stem is seen only in Tulu (aḍē-vuni).

*adáḷ-,"to start, be alarmed",,,,,,,,,,,"Joined by Burrow & Emeneau with*adír-'to shake, tremble'. If we think of the original root as*ad-with later suffixal additions, this is quite probable. However, the fact of there being two phonologically different stems cannot be denied (cf. Tamilatirvs.ataṭṭu<*ataḷ-tu; Tel.adaruvs.adalu), and although the meanings are not always differentiated (cf., however, the differentiation in Telugu), this is sufficient evidence for at least granting them two different entries. // Present in 2/6 branches.",,,,,,,1,8,

*aḌ[Ḍ]- (?),thirst; hunger,,,,,,,,,,,"A rather odd bunch of forms. First of all, Kan.nīr-aṛkeis not easy to trace back tonīr-aḍike; its second component should better fit in with such forms asaṛipu'desire, affection',aṛkar_'love' (see PSDR*aṛi-, *aṛk-). Second, Kolamiaḍḍ-and Parji/Gadbaanḍ-cannot go back to one and the same prototype either (the former suggests*aḍḍ-, the latter*anḍ-or*and_-). We are obviously dealing with different etymons here - or at least a mix of original and contaminated forms. Dubious. // Present in 3/6 branches.",,,,,,,1,10,
*ádda- [?],mirror,,,,,,,,,,,"A cultural term with an extremely low probability of being PDr; in fact, most of the forms can be explained as borrowings from Telugu (cf. also Tamilattamid., explicitly marked as a borrowing in DEDR). Nevertheless, the origins of the Telugu form are obscure; Burrow & Emeneau compare Prakritaddāa-'mirror', but the word does not seem to have an IE etymology and may be of Dravidian origin. // Present in 3/6 branches.",,,,,,,1,11,
*áḍḍa- ~ *aḍái-,to hinder; obstacle,,,,,,,,,,,"The best evidence for the inlaut voiced geminate comes from South Dravidian languages (Kannada, Kodagu, and Tulu; in the Nilgiris gemination was lost due to the geminate finding itself in the absolute auslaut position after the syncopation of the last syllable) and Telugu. As for Central Dravidian forms, many of them may actually reflect old re-borrowings from Telugu, due to both the irregular-min the auslaut and the scarceness of the forms (in many languages, only*aḍḍa-m""obstacle"" is attested without the corresponding verbal stems). However, Kondaaṛkandaḍi-are probably original. So are the NDR forms.

*adúm-,"to squeeze, press",,,,,,,,,,,"The auslaut-m-in this root is only ""detached"" in Tamil, and even there in most forms it can be explained as the result of a secondary loss; its status as part of the root is quite obviously Proto-Dravidian. // Present in 4/6 branches.",,,,,,,1,19,

*aj-,mother,,Nostratic etymology,,,,,,,,,"The word was used with pronominal prefixes in PDR:*tāy'his, her mother', etc. (some of these forms are innovative). The vowel was presumably long only in prefixed forms, and later was analogized in such languages as Tamil (āy'mother').",,,,,,,2,17,
*ája-,an elder relative (father's brother; grandfather; father),,,,,,,,,,,"A widespread Dravidian root, although the basic meaning 'father' should probably be deemed secondary due to PDR already possessing two more likely candidates:*ápa-(coll.) and*-and_-(hon.).

See the South Dravidian entry for the possibility of separating SDR*ala-'suffer' from SDR*alai-'wander, shake;caus.harass, annoy'. In this respect it is interesting to consider some of the syncopated/non-syncopated doublets given by Burrow & Emeneau in the same entry: cf. Kuialāṛivs.laha'languor, laziness'; Kur.algāvs.layākoyā, etc. Of course, a final judgement is different to give based on lack of definitive knowledge on the rules of vowel reduction in Gondwan (not to mention North Dravidian, where initiall-is exceedingly rare in the first place). // Present in 5/6 branches.",,,,,,,3,10,

*alág-,blade; splint,,Nostratic etymology,,,,,,,,,"Tamil distinguishes betweenalaku'blade' andalakku'splint'; however, given the general lack of stability among 2nd syllable stops, this differentiation should probably be considered secondary.

*alár-,to blossom,,,,,,,,,,,"The stem is never met without the final resonant, although it certainly cannot be guaranteed that*-r-was not detachable as a suffix in PDR. It is interesting to note the similarity between*alár-and PDR*mala[r]-with pretty much the same meaning. However, to treat this case as an irregular development*m->0-(see, e. g., [Андронов 1994: 86] ) is hardly admissible. Much more probable is semantic confusion between two originally different roots; in fact, SDRmalar'to blossom' may eventually be nothing but the result of contamination between*alár-and*mal-'fertile, to abound'. // Present in 2/6 branches.",,,,,,,3,18,

*áma-,mother (hon.),,Nostratic etymology,,,,,,,,,"The most common, and most certainly, primary meaning of the stem is 'mother'; however, much like*ápa-, this is the ""formal"" root for this relative, and is in that function opposed to*aj-q. v. // Present in 5/6 branches.",,,,,,,4,3,
*amái-,to fit together; to be useful; to prepare,,,,,,,,,,,"Outside SDR and Telugu only found in Kuwi (ambrinai'to suit'), where it is most likely borrowed from Telugu (unless other parallels in Central Dravidian eventually show up). The root is completely homonymous with*amai-'to be calm, settled', right down to the same opposition of the-ai-stem and the-r-stem; however, it does not seem prudent to join the two under one entry, although occasional semantic contamination may be present. A particular problem is the root's relationship with*sav-(*sam-?) 'to be ready'; I find it hard to trace both variants to a single PDR root and would suggest phonetic contamination (i. e.*sav->*sam-in many dialects under the influence of*amai-) between two roots with similar meanings. // Present in 2/6 branches.",,,,,,,4,4,
*amai-,"to be calm, settled",,Nostratic etymology,,,,,,,,,"A rather local SDR root but certainly quite ""Dravidian"" in form. Burrow & Emeneau compare it with*am-'to be pressed down, crushed' (> 'to settle'), but I would rather opt for homonymity here (occasional semantic contamination with*amai-'to fit together' is also possible).

*amb-,arrow,,,,,,,,,,,Forms like Tamilappu-kkaṭṭu'sheaf of arrows'; Teluguampar_a(pl.) 'arrows'; and possibly Gondwan plural forms inap-hint at the PDR status of the morphological gradation*amb-(sg. stem) ~*amp-(plural and derivative forms). // Present in 4/6 branches.,,,,,,,4,6,

*ámbali,rice-water; rice gruel,,Nostratic etymology,,,,,,,,,The presence of the root in North Dravidian clearly validates its PDR status (otherwise one could argue that all Central Dravidian languages - as well as some South Dravidian ones - have borrowed the form from Telugu). // Present in 5/6 branches.,,,,,,,4,8,

The two stems, bisyllabic and monosyllabic with retroflex cluster, may well be related on a higher level (with the original root being*aṇ-, which then may have been preserved as an archaism in Tam.aṇṇu), but separate origins cannot be excluded either. // Present in 6/6 branches.",,,,,,,4,13,
*aṇá-ŋ-,to suffer; to suppress,,Nostratic etymology,,,,,,,,,"Cf. also Betul Gondian-c-ānā""to press"". Considering that one of the meanings in Tamil is ""be slain"", it is possible to suggest historical derivation from P(S)DR*aṇai-'to extinguish, die' (in which case the Gondi match hardly fits, but it is an isolated one-dialect form anyway). In DEDR the Kolami-Gadba forms are grouped with PDR*aẓí-'to perish, be ruined', but the nasal consonant in PKG is too well defined to ignore; the current etymology seems to be just as plausible semantically and better phonetically. // Present in 3/6 branches.",,,,,,,4,14,

Of course, if we assume the suffixal nature of the resonant, the question is resolved, although the meaning of the suffix is still unclear. No traces of the root are seen in SDR, where the main word for 'fall' is*vīẓ-- which, in its turn, has been quite poorly preserved outside of SDR. Some overlapping, however, exists, which leads us to surmise that the difference between the two roots in PDR must have been stylistic -*arí-/*arál-being the neutral, unmarked 'fall', and*vīẓ-being its ""Magn"" correlate, i. e.

More often than not, the semantics of the stem is closely linked to the idea of old age or being elder (cf. 'old woman'; 'grandmother'; 'matron'; 'elder brother's wife'). The relations of this root with PDR*átaiare also unclear.
