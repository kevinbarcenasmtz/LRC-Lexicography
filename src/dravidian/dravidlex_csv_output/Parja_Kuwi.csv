"aya (pl. -ska) ""woman""",mother; woman,,Gondwan etymology,,"Also Kuwi_Fmāiyamy mother,māyayour mother;aiyawoman; Kuwi_Smāyiamy, our mother,mīyayour mother; Kuwi_Suiya(pl.-ska) mother;mīyayour mother",,,,,,,"The forms*ayaand*yayaactually had different meanings in PK  (as well as in PDR) -     'woman' and 'mother' respectively. However, in modern dialects they have been  often contaminated,     as in Kui. Moreover, some Kuwi dialects have inherited PDR possessive forms, or,  rather, the     tendency of their ""possessivisation"": the formmāiyagoes back to*mā-yaya'us +  mother',      while  Kuwi_Fmāyaand Kuwi_Smīyago back to*mī-yaya'you +  mother'.  The initial*y-in the form for 'mother' has to be postulated principally because of different vocalism   in     these    two  forms (cf. PK*yamb-> Kuwi_Famb-, Kuwi_Simb-). In Kuwi_F*yaya>*īya(and not*āya, which would have been regular) because of the influence of  the following-y-(like*yambi>imbibecause of the following-i-). In   Kui  the   variants-i-and-j-seem to be free; the variant-j-should be the regular one,  but  we  may  suggest that the variant with-i-has been preserved for expressive reasons. As  for other Kui  dialects, it is hard to say whether some of them have lost one of the two forms  (*ayaand*yaya), having generalized the other one for both meanings, or whether they have  merged  phonetically,  since  reflexes  of  PK*ya-are unknown. Thus,  Kuwi_Isrāyamay   reflectaya, having lost the form*yaya, or may represent both of them, if we suggest a  development*ya->ā-(indeed, the second explanation is preferable, since otherwise it is  impossible to  explain the vowel length).",,,364,,2,,,,https://starlingdb.org/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&basename=%2fdata%2fdrav%2fkuiet&text_number=35&root=config
