The initial*y-in the form for 'mother' has to be postulated principally because of different vocalism   in     these    two  forms (cf. PK*yamb-> Kuwi_Famb-, Kuwi_Simb-). In Kuwi_F*yaya>*īya(and not*āya, which would have been regular) because of the influence of  the following-y-(like*yambi>imbibecause of the following-i-). In   Kui  the   variants-i-and-j-seem to be free; the variant-j-should be the regular one,  but  we  may  suggest that the variant with-i-has been preserved for expressive reasons. As  for other Kui  dialects, it is hard to say whether some of them have lost one of the two forms  (*ayaand*yaya), having generalized the other one for both meanings, or whether they have  merged  phonetically,  since  reflexes  of  PK*ya-are unknown. Thus,  Kuwi_Isrāyamay   reflectaya, having lost the form*yaya, or may represent both of them, if we suggest a  development*ya->ā-(indeed, the second explanation is preferable, since otherwise it is  impossible to  explain the vowel length).",,,364,,2,,,,https://starlingdb.org/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&basename=%2fdata%2fdrav%2fkuiet&text_number=35&root=config

*kir-ɣu,ear,,Dravidian etymology,,,,,,,,,"This extremely interesting root deserves a detailed commentary. The standard Dravidian root for ear    is*kev-(DEDR 1977, see PGn*kev-). The PK form for 'ear' thus stands isolated, the only    obvious decent comparison being Tuluceraḍu'ear', which is, moreover, dialectal and partly    irregular (palatalisation*k->c-in Tulu is a rare and uncertain thing). In [Burrow 1944]    both roots were compared with the Uralic forms for 'ear', especially Finnishkorva, etc., and  it   was concluded that both date back to PDR*kervi.This, however, seems highly unprobable.  Loss  of-r-everywhere but in Kui-Kuwi is an extremely strange and unique phenomenon,  especially   considering that not even a single trace of it was preserved in neither of the SDR  languages (where   we could at least expect some sort of gemination, like Tamil*cevviinstead  ofcevi).  Much  more probable is the connection of the PK form with the Dravidian words for  'ear-wax' (also  discussed by T. Burrow in [Burrow 1943]). The word should be reconstructed as*kiru-pīl,  'ear-excrements', and it has undergone radical transformations in most languages,  the most archaic  form being Tulukirmbilu. In most other languages the first syllable vowel was  assimilated to the inlaut combination of labialized sounds (Tamilkur_umpi, PG*koṛ-ŋel,  etc.); in Gondi we have the following development:*kirupīl>*korupīl> *koṛmbīl>*koṛŋīl>*koṛŋel.      The general situation is thus as follows. In Early Dravidian both forms (*kir-and*kev-) were co-existent, although the difference between them is unclear. Later the form*kir-was in most dialects completely replaced by the form*kev-and survived as an archaism only in PK (and in Tulu?). The original derivative*kirupīlsurvived, but in most dialects it was modified beyond recognition, especially since the origins of its derivation became lost.",,,,,1,,,,https://starlingdb.org/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&basename=%2fdata%2fdrav%2fgndet&text_number=310&root=config

However, if we  assume this reconstruction, it would be quite possible to compare this form with SDR*kir_-'small' (DEDR 1594), especially since there is an appropriate parallel in Todakɨt_ eɫ̣f'ankle', literally 'small bone'.
