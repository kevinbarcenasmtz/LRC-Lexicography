# Tasks did/working on for the week of 04-22-2025

As of now we have multiple "full original entry" values per row in our datasets these are the 'Alonso de Molina', 'Frances Karttunen', 'Horacio Carochi / English', 'Andrés de Olmos', and 'Lockhart’s Nahuatl as Written' columns. Essentially the system (database) needs to have duplicate entries varying on the number of full original entry values there are.

So the table would look like this (actually we should just append a full original entry column, as removing where that full original entry came from could be a problem later)

| Headword | Orthographic Variants | Full Original Entry |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |

it looks like this right now

| Headword | Orthographic Variants | Alonso de Molina | Frances Karttunen | Horacio Carochi / English | Andrés de Olmos | Lockhart’s Nahuatl as Written |
| -------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |

For the unique id's we need a way to undo these changes just in case we change our minds in the future. The suggested approach to entries that get split is have those id's be variants of the original entry that got split.

Another approach to the above issue is adding a column called "original row id" and setting *that* value to original's entry ID. Then to the following splitted entries we can just use a variation of *that* id.

Also it would be ideal to test the "attestations" columns and see if the content in those columns appear in the later columns. The columns we consider to be the "full original entry" columns. (no values appear in the later columns see notebook)
